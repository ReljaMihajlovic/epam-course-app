# EPAM Front-End Specialization Course Project
This project is a part of the EPAM Front-End Specialization Course. It is a full-stack application with the front-end developed in React and the back-end provided by the EPAM team.

## React Components
In this project, we have used React components to build a modular and reusable user interface. Each component has its own logic and controls a part of the UI.

## React State and Hooks
We have used React's built-in state and hooks to manage component state. This allows us to create stateful logic and side effects in our components.

## React Router
React Router is used for navigation in our application. It allows us to create multiple routes and navigate between different components based on the URL.

## React State Management
For managing the application state, we have used Redux. It provides a global store that holds the application state, and we can dispatch actions to update this state.

## Async Redux
To handle asynchronous actions in Redux, we have used redux-thunk middleware. It allows us to write action creators that return a function instead of an action, which can be used to delay the dispatch of an action or to dispatch only if certain conditions are met.
